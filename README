Directory Structure
###################
AvgNNNPearson/: Contains the Average N-Nearest Neighbors with Pearson Similarity implementation.
WeightedNNNPearson/: Contains the Weighted N-Nearest Neighbors with Pearson Similarity implementation.
WeightedNNNCosine/: Contains the Weighted N-Nearest Neighbors with Cosine Similarity implementation.
MeanUtility/: Contains the Mean Utility method implementation.
Utilities/: Contains utility functions such as mean absolute error calculation and data preprocessing.

Running the Evaluation Scripts
##############################
EvaluateCFRandom.py: Evaluates the collaborative filtering techniques using a random sampling of user-item pairs.
Usage: python EvaluateCFRandom.py <MethodIndex> <Size> <Repeats>

EvaluateCFList.py: Evaluates the collaborative filtering techniques using a specified list of user-item pairs.
Usage: python EvaluateCFList.py <MethodIndex> <TestCasesFilename>
Where <MethodIndex> is the index of the method to evaluate (0-3), <Size> is the number of test cases to generate, and <Repeats> is the number of times the test is to be repeated.

The data/ directory contains the Jester dataset used for the evaluations.
